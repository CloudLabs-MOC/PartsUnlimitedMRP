### Summary:

In this lab you deployed the PU MRP app, via a Chef Automate server in Azure, to an application server. You completed the following tasks:

 - Configured a workstation to connect and interact with the Chef Automate server.
 - Created a cookbook and recipe for the PU MRP application and its dependencies, to automate the installation of the PU MRP application.
 - Uploaded a cookbook to the Chef Automate server.
 - Created a Role to define a baseline set of cookbooks and attributes that can be applied to multiple servers.
 - Bootstrapped the Linux VM to add the Role to the Node, i.e. deployed the PU MRP application to it using Chef.

This hands-on lab was designed to show you one option for integrating Chef with Azure. This lab also demonstrates how run lists, nodes, cookbooks, roles and recipes can be created and deployed on Azure.
