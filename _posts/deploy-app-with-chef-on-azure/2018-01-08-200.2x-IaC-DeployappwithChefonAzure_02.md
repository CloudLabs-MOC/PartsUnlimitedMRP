> Substitute with **Mrpvmdnsname**, **MrpvmUsername** and **MrpvmPassword** from the Environments output page provided to you in the below command

 ```
 knife bootstrap <FQDN-for-MRP-App-VM> --ssh-user <mrp-app-admin-username> --ssh-password <mrp-app-admin-password> --node-name mrp-app --run-list role[partsrole] 
	--sudo --verbose
 ```

 The script should take between 5 to 10 minutes to run. You will see the script perform the following operations:

 - Install Chef on the VM.
 - Assign the `mrp` Chef role to the VM.
 - Run the `mrpapp` recipe.

 **Potential Errors and Issues**

 - The installation may not do anything for the first minute, while it connects and prepares to run. However, if it hangs for more than 5 to 10 minutes, cancel the run and note any error messages that are returned.
 - If error messages relate to disconnecting from the remote host, it may be a username or password issue. You should recheck the user account details on the Chef Automate server, and on the Linux VM. Use PuTTy to sign in to the VMs.
 - You can also set up the connection to use certificates instead of a username and password.
 - If there is an error related to resolving the run list, you will need to run the following command in Chef DK and try again. This command will make sure the missing role is in the node.

 ```
 knife node run_list add mrp-app 'role[partsrole]'
 ```

1. Open the URL you chose for your public DNS name in a web browser, with the suffix `:9080/mrp/`. The URL should be in the following format `http:`//`<mrp-dns-name>`.`<region>`.`cloudapp.azure.com:9080/mrp/`. If the installation was successful, you should see the PU MRP application landing web page.

1. Explore the web site and check that it functions normally.

1. Visit the URL for your Chef Automate server in your web browser, for example `https://chefautomateek017.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`. Log in to your Chef Automate server. From the **Chef Automate Dashboard**, go to the **Nodes** area. Verify the PU MRP Application VM is listed as node `mrp-app`.

 Examine the details listed under the **Resources**, **Run List** and **Attributes** tabs, and verify that the details are as expected.

The mrp-app node, and the tabs Nodes, Resources, Run List and Attributes are highlighted to illustrate how to access these areas from the dashboard, in order to verify their settings and details.](/assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-feb2019/chef_chefautodashboard.png)


 > **Note**: You can manage your Chef server configuration and node deployments via a web browser by installing the *Chef Management Console*. Go to your Chef Automate server deployment organization page by appending `/organizations/default` to the URL you use to access your Chef Automate server. The resulting URL should be similar to `https:`//`< your chef automate server dns name >`.`< region >`.`cloudapp.azure.com`/`organizations/default`. Visit the URL, and follow the instructions on the web page to install the Chef Management Console.

### Summary:

In this lab you deployed the PU MRP app, via a Chef Automate server in Azure, to an application server. You completed the following tasks:

 - Configured a workstation to connect and interact with the Chef Automate server.
 - Created a cookbook and recipe for the PU MRP application and its dependencies, to automate the installation of the PU MRP application.
 - Uploaded a cookbook to the Chef Automate server.
 - Created a Role to define a baseline set of cookbooks and attributes that can be applied to multiple servers.
 - Bootstrapped the Linux VM to add the Role to the Node, i.e. deployed the PU MRP application to it using Chef.

This hands-on lab was designed to show you one option for integrating Chef with Azure. This lab also demonstrates how run lists, nodes, cookbooks, roles and recipes can be created and deployed on Azure.
